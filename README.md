# OpenGL_Java_Exercising
This is my exercise repository from the book Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL With c++.
It is for my private usage. The code in here are not 100% as same as the book.
I had added my own creativity.

NOTE: some programs may not display properly, it's maybe because models from old programs
 uses only a same VAO, but my new models use independent VAOs. 
If You want to check out the old programs, going back to the previous commits is probably the best method.
